# Automate setup on fresh ubuntu

A script that installs all the tools I need on a fresh Ubuntu distro. Getting to start working on awesome things as soon as possible :sunglasses:

## How to use it

* open a terminal instance
* run `touch setup && gedit $_`
* past the content of the file
* run `sudo bash setup $HOME`
